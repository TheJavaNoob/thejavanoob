				The grasp of darkness has reached its demise, the ever mighty, ever mysterious, ever nourishing being known as the sea has begun the daily endeavor of embracing enlightenment from the big fireball itself. 
				<span class="time-marker">(0:05)</span>The perpetual movement of the waves added an ominous beat to the peaceful morning. 
				And a thick coat of mist, the remains of the battle between the warmth of the ocean and the excruciating cold of winter dawn, rose about to obscure any fine detail of the peaceful view. 
				Though The sun has casted a faintest glimpse of phosphorus light along the farthest of horizon, he was reluctant to make his own entry. 
				Despite which, beings and creatures living off the sea, like the ring of an angel or pilgrims around Jerusalem, arose at the first sign of light. 
				Some, like the waves, had not even the concept of day and night, living in their own will. For them, it‚Äôs themselves‚Äìnot the sea, that governs the sacred cycle of livelihood. 
				The authorities of the sea come from his undisputed nature, where days and nights come and go at a steady cycle of twenty-four hours, whether it‚Äôs wanted or hoped.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually, the peace of dawn is broken. <span class="time-marker">(0:26)</span>From the deep withins of the suffocating mist, came a elongated howl from a seabird whose species is unknown. 
				These howls are the marine equivalent of roosters' call, signaling the arrival of the day. 
				Swiftly, it was met by an answer, more distant, more muffled, but an answer nonetheless. 
				The pioneering calls ignited the lives of the sea. One after another, seabirds join the meet for early-comers, their calls resonates, accumulates into a quartet of sorts, to wake those still asleep, to call on for the sun‚Äôs appearance. 
				They did not fall on deaf ears. <span class="time-marker">(1:15)</span>The washing of the waves grew louder and clearer, and there it came! 
				A sliver of overwhelming brightness, cutting through the mist, brought with it an incredible aura. 
				Even millions of times of looking at the oceanic sunrise, the brightness of Helios, which exceeds anything prior, is still beyond the realms of comprehension. 
				Though the sun has not shown its full image, at this point, light was all but an unutterable reality. 
				More seabirds joined with a more determined sound, declaring that no darkness can resist the arrival of light, and no night can defy the enlightenment of day. 
				To the affirmation of such belief, waves pushed higher into the sky one after another, celebrating a new day‚Äôs infancy.<span class="time-marker">(1:33)</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Along the shore that only became visible through the obscurity, sat a small bay. 
				No more than a few boats resided under its protection, but work of the fishermen has started long before. 
				The iterating waves pushed their yet empty hull into an unceasing wobble, but it‚Äôs much acquainted to the fishermen and more than gentle for this calm day. 
				The labor of the fishermen harmonized with the rhythm of the sea. They untangled their nets, polished their harpoons and mixed their baits preceding a day of voyage, all of which moved like a singing melody, as naturally and as gladly as a choreographed dance. 
				<span class="time-marker">(2:16)</span>By the time the first boats reached into the vastness of the sea, the sun has only came partially above the horizon.<span class="time-marker">(2:30)</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				If one were one of the seabirds with that exclusive aerial view, they can see boats traversing the vast, empty ocean under a pale blue sky, leaving long tracks of waves behind, forming a map of intersecting white lines, the tips of moving slowly and peacefully towards their destination. 
				<span class="time-marker">(2:50)</span>On the boats, fishermen are absorbed in the tasks, nets were spread, hooks were deployed, to get ready for the night‚Äôs harvest.<span class="time-marker">(3:14)</span>
				But, in the untimely moment, the sun ascended into a few pieces of the newly gathering white cloud. 
				Magic of light immediately transformed itself into a gentle, milky, misty halo, that of an summer afternoon after rain. 
				Soon, temporary darkness engulfed the ocean, with stray columns of light piercing through occasionally. 
				<span class="time-marker">(3:40)</span>The works of the piscatory is far from interrupted, merely aided by the temporary absence of burning sun, they hurried to finish their deployment of equipments. 
				Pushing, pulling, pushing, pulling‚Ä¶ the heavy nets were repelled by tens of meters following gushes of roars, bringing with them a pearl-string of droplets. 
				<span class="time-marker">(4:28)</span>Eventually, sounds died down, as the valuable noon‚Äôs rest came about.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let us return to the materials of the ocean itself ‚Äî water. As the mighty waves are propelled by marine forces, striking and pounding on the rigid rocks on the shore, they break down into millions of pieces, all of which fall back into the sea and orchestrated the complicated polyphonic fabric of the music of the sea. 
				The the waves then reside, rolling and playing as the shore-bound currents meet the returning ones. <span id="mark4">(5:28)</span>
				One after another, waves pushed on and pulled off, in the silver lining along the hundreds of miles of coast. 
				In the unpredictable nature of nature, waves come in and out of existence arbitrarily. 
				<span class="time-marker">(6:00)</span>At times forming titanic walls of swirls, 
				<span class="time-marker">(6:26)</span>while at times only acting as a rhythmic accompaniment to the scorching wind, 
				and, even, <span class="time-marker">(6:38)</span>at times fading into relative peace, accumulating power, 
				as is happening this particular moment in this particular gloomy noon.
			</p>
			<p>
				Silence, no vocals of human, no percussions of waves, no blowings of the wind, and no sign of the sun - the conductor of the symphony of La Mer.
				<span class="time-marker">(7:20)</span>Its powerful rays were helplessly blocked by low-hanging clouds, grey and menacing, twirling and roaring. 
				Only among the cracks of the cloud could light overflow the silver lining, Tyndalling golden pillars of light across the vast expanse of the peaceful sea. 
				Ships and boats scatter carelessly on the endless plains of water, between them the golden pillars of light come and go. 
				It was a sight of true serenity.
			</p>
			<p>
				But, out of nowhere, <span class="time-marker">(8:12)</span>came a gust of wind, so very slight, so very refreshing. 
				Carrying the anticipation of the universal creatures, it accumulated in power, stronger and stronger, gust after gust. 
				His aim was the clouds, the barrier of light, the carrier of shadow, and he made his attack. 
				<span class="time-marker">(8:35)</span>No efforts come in vain, no struggles end futile. 
				The clouds have fled aside from the incredible power, the heavenly rays of gold has once again showered the world! 
				And all was complete, in this splendid winter noon on the ever admirable sea.
