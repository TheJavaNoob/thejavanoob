            <p> Hello Internet! I am Steve (Haoxiang) Lin, an undergraduate at Zhejiang University-University of
                  Illinois Urbana-Champaign joint institute (that's a mouthful). I am an enthusiastic software
                  developer, a novice researcher, a diehard classical music fan, an average runner, and a
                  literature and linguistic nerd.

            <h1> Development </h1>
            <p>I do programming with a vast number of lanuages. I did projects in VB, HTML/JS/CSS, Python, C+/Qt,
                  Swift and counting. I have also touched Objective-C and C#. (No, Java is not on here. I had enough
                  of downloading JVM everywhere and ditched it long ago. It only lives in the name now).

                  (or even ongoing projects

            <h1> Music </h1>
            <p>I am a diehard (exclusive) classical music fan, having listened to 500+ pieces from the Baroque period
                  to the 21st century (Yes, this is still Classical music). My favorite composer is Beethoven, followed
                  by Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms.</p>
            <p> I also play the piano and I spend more time on it than I would like. Rachmaninov's second piano sonata
                  has taken 1.5 years of my time, and I am only 2/3 of the way through it.</p>
            </p>
            <p> I have tried to do composing, but only made one composition. You can listen to them on Bilibili.
